   <h3>Plot</h3> 
    <h4>In this romantic comedy story, a dim witted high school girl named Kotoko Aihara finally confesses her romantic feelings to a fellow senior named Naoki
        that she has been infatuated with from afar since she saw him on their first day of high school. However, Naoki, a hottie "super-ikemen" (handsome male) 
        who is smart and good at sports, rejects her offhand. Fate intervenes when a mild earthquake ruins Kotoko's family house. While the house is rebuilt, 
        Kotoko and her father stay at the home of her father's childhood best friend, whose son is revealed to be Naoki.
        Naoki eventually falls for Kotoko despite her clingy ways and childish behavior and starts to have romantic, protective feelings for her.</h4>
